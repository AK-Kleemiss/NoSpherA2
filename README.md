This repository exists for NoSpherA2, a software to calculate a .tsc file and property grid files form a given wavefunction. The .tsc file is a format to be used in olex2.refine for the use of non-spherical scattering- or form-factors during the refinement, enabling refinemnts like HAR (Hirshfeld-Atom-Refinement).

NoSpherA2 is published in Chem. Sci., 2021,12, 1675-1692 (https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/sc/d0sc05526c).
