This project aims to provide an open source natural science audience aimed all-in-one solution for the calculation of scattering factors from DFT or wavefunction methods.
Recent updates include OCC as an on-board wavefunction calculator for on-the-fly generation of information.
Attack safety is not the top priority, but speed and robustness, as well as sanity chek of inputs are improtant!
