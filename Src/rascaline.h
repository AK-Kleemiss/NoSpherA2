   * The following gradients are available:

   *   atomic positions, with fixed cell matrix parameters. Positions

   *   atom :math:`i` and :math:`\mathbf{r_j}` is the position vector of the
   *   atom :math:`j`.
   *
   *   **Note**: Position gradients of an atom are computed with respect to all
   *   other atoms within the representation. To recover the force one has to
   *   accumulate all pairs associated with atom :math:`i`.
   *
   * - ``"strain"``, for gradients of the representation with respect to
   *   strain. These gradients are typically used to compute the virial, and
   *   from there the pressure acting on a system. To compute them, we
   *   pretend that all the positions :math:`\mathbf r` and unit cell
   *   :math:`\mathbf H` have been scaled by a strain matrix
   *   :math:`\epsilon`:
   *
   *   .. math::
   *      \mathbf r &\rightarrow \mathbf r \left(\mathbb{1} + \epsilon \right)\\
   *      \mathbf H &\rightarrow \mathbf H \left(\mathbb{1} + \epsilon \right)
   *
   *   and then take the gradients of the representation with respect to this
   *   matrix:
   *
   *   .. math::
   *       \frac{\partial \langle q \vert A_i \rangle} {\partial \mathbf{\epsilon}}
   *
   * - ``"cell"``, for gradients of the representation with respect to the
   *   system's cell parameters. These gradients are computed at fixed
   *   positions, and often not what you want when computing gradients
   *   explicitly (they are mainly used in ``rascaline.torch`` to integrate
   *   with backward propagation). If you are trying to compute the virial
   *   or the stress, you should use ``"strain"`` gradients instead.
   *
   *   .. math::
   *       \left. \frac{\partial \langle q \vert A_i \rangle}
